#
# Makefile for your PHP extension
#
# This Makefile is designed to help you build and install your PHP extension
# on XAMPP with PHP version 8.2 on Arch Linux.
#

# Name of your extension
NAME = yourextension

#
#	The extension dirs
#
#	This is normally a directory like /usr/lib/php5/20121221 (based on the 
#	PHP version that you use. We make use of the command line 'php-config' 
#	instruction to find out what the extension directory is, you can override
#	this with a different fixed directory
#

EXTENSION_DIR		=	$(shell /opt/lampp/bin/php-config --extension-dir)

# TODO: add line extension=yourextension.so to /opt/lampp/etc/php.ini

#
#	The name of the extension
#
#	These two variables are based on the name of the extension. We simply add
#	a certain extension to them (.so or .ini)
#

EXTENSION 			=	${NAME}.so

#
#	Compiler
#
#	By default, the GNU C++ compiler is used. If you want to use a different
#	compiler, you can change that here. You can change this for both the 
#	compiler (the program that turns the c++ files into object files) and for
#	the linker (the program that links all object files into the single .so
#	library file. By default, g++ (the GNU C++ compiler) is used for both.
#

COMPILER			=	g++
LINKER				=	g++

#
#	Compiler and linker flags
#
#	This variable holds the flags that are passed to the compiler. By default, 
# 	we include the -O2 flag. This flag tells the compiler to optimize the code, 
#	but it makes debugging more difficult. So if you're debugging your application, 
#	you probably want to remove this -O2 flag. At the same time, you can then 
#	add the -g flag to instruct the compiler to include debug information in
#	the library (but this will make the final libphpcpp.so file much bigger, so
#	you want to leave that flag out on production servers).
#
#	If your extension depends on other libraries (and it does at least depend on
#	one: the PHP-CPP library), you should update the LINKER_DEPENDENCIES variable
#	with a list of all flags that should be passed to the linker.
#

COMPILER_FLAGS		= -Wall -c -O2 -std=c++11 -fpic -o
LINKER_FLAGS		=	-shared
LINKER_DEPENDENCIES	=	-lphpcpp

#
#	Command to remove files, copy files and create directories.
#
#	I've never encountered a *nix environment in which these commands do not work. 
#	So you can probably leave this as it is
#

RM					=	rm -f
CP					=	cp -f

#
#	All source files are simply all *.cpp files found in the current directory
#
#	A builtin Makefile macro is used to scan the current directory and find 
#	all source files. The object files are all compiled versions of the source
#	file, with the .cpp extension being replaced by .o.
#

SOURCES				=	$(wildcard *.cpp)
OBJECTS				=	$(SOURCES:%.cpp=%.o)

#
#	From here the build instructions start
#
